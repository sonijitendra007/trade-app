    , 2019-08-12        joo        null        10025.0

3. Some test coverage is provided for few classes as per time available but ideal would be 100% coverage.

4. InstructionBuilder can be used to create sample data

5. pom.xml contains all the dependencies used in the project

5. Assumptions:
    - InstructionApp as an interface to read client Instructions for trading/settlement
